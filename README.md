# NextCRM

NextCRM is a CRM build on top of the Next.JS 13.4 using TypeScript, great UI library shadcn, Prisma and MongoDB as a database. Uploadthings as a S3 blob for document storage. You can try it with credentials: demo@nextcrm.io / demo12345 or login via google account but there is a pending state for new user which must by allowed by demo@nextcrm.io

## What we use to build it

shadcn - UI
Prisma ORM - together with mongoDB (tested with version 5.0)
useSWR - for client side data fetching
NextAUTH - for user authentication

## Warning

If you create new user in demo instance there is a PENDING state, you must log in as a demo@nextcrm.io and active new user in admin section!
